#### Ablation study:-
 
 - *Activation function*: On a small data set I found that not using any activation is better than using a tanh function which is even better than using a maxout. 
 - *Dimension of embedding*: I observed that a dimension of 300 was better than 100 and 500 both 
 - *Decoder hidden layer size*: I observed that 1000 was better than 2000
